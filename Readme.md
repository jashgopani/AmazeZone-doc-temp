# CSC/ECE 517 Ruby on Rails: Online Shopping System

## Description

We will be implementing a simple online shopping portal where registered users can view and purchase products. This project will not focus on basic data validations or edge cases. Instead, it will focus on implementing different functionalities and introducing different concepts which will help in your projects. The general strategy for RoR frontend is to create classes with the scaffold, and then link them together by implementing associations. The difference between Typescript(TS) frontend and RoR frontend is that TS is not an MVC, and has a separate front end which communicates to the Ruby on Rails API backend. The functionalities are limited but the scope of learning will be broader.

## Functionalities

The simple online shopping system that we will build will have the following features. The user will be able to:

1. Register for the shopping website  
2. Create sessions by login and logout  
3. Purchase multiple items  
4. View their purchase history till date  
5. Will not be able to view pages that they arenâ€™t authorized to view
